#Samsung has released a total of 465 phones since 2007, peaking at 51 phones released in 2020. They have declined in the two years since, however they still release more per year than they did five years ago. 

Although the stock price for Samsung is significantly higher than Apple, it appears that Apple produces more revenue per sale then Samsung. Apple has also issued a higher volume of stocks available at a lower price then Samsung. There also does not appear to be any correlation between phones being released and stock price. On the days the phones were released the stock volumes increased significantly, but there was abnormal fluctuations in  stock price.
